# Setting Up

To get started, follow these steps to include the particleQuest JavaScript file and adjust the script to target an existing canvas element:

1. Include the particleQuest script in the header or footer of your HTML file, no other scripts are required:

```html
<script src="./particleQuest.min.js"></script>
```

2. Add a canvas element to your HTML:

```html
<canvas id="myCanvas" width="800" height="600"></canvas>
```

3. Adjust the script to initialize the particle animation on an existing canvas element:

```js
new particleQuest({
    canvasSelector: "#myCanvas",
    speed: 200,
    speedToEndDirection: 200,
    maxParticleSize: 200,
    textParticles: [üöÄ,üõ∏,üõ∞Ô∏è],
});
```

Wait for the script to load with `window.onload` or `DOMContentLoaded`.
